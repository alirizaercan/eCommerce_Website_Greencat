# E-Commerce Sales and Demand Forecasting Platform

## Overview

The **E-Commerce Sales and Demand Forecasting Platform** aims to develop a web application that allows users to view, analyze, and interact with sales and demand forecasts for an e-commerce platform. This project utilizes data engineering, data science techniques, and a comprehensive database management system to process, store, and analyze e-commerce data. The system allows for manual data collection and processing, providing insights into sales trends, product demand, and user behavior.

This project is part of the **Database Management Systems** course, focusing on advanced techniques in database management, backend development using Flask, and frontend development with ReactJS.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a platform where e-commerce sales data and demand forecasts can be easily accessed and analyzed. The system will include functionalities for data processing, visualization, reporting, and machine learning-based sales forecasting. It will also incorporate user interactivity and allow for feedback collection to improve the platform over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL
- **Web Framework**: Flask (Backend), ReactJS (Frontend)
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS
- **Other Tools**: Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS (for UI design)

## Project Content and Structure

### 1. Data Collection

- **Data Sources**: Datasets related to e-commerce will be downloaded from open data sources like Kaggle. Example datasets include product sales, user reviews, pricing data, and product categories.
  
- **Manual Data Collection**: Data will be manually gathered from e-commerce websites, including product details, prices, stock status, categories, and user reviews.

### 2. Data Processing and Cleaning

- **Data Processing with Python**: The data will be cleaned and organized using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Operations like handling missing values, detecting anomalies, and converting data types will be performed.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations like sales trends, user review distributions, and sales graphs categorized by product will be created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 3. Database Management and Storage

- **Database Utilization**: The data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database. Tables will be designed to store product information, sales data, and user reviews.
  
- **Data Modeling**: The database schema will include tables for products, sales, users, and reviews, structured to facilitate efficient querying and reporting.

### 4. Analysis and Modeling

- **Demand and Sales Forecasting**: Statistical analysis and machine learning techniques will be used to predict future sales and demand using historical data. Libraries such as scikit-learn will be utilized to implement time series forecasting models.
  
- **A/B Testing**: A/B tests will be performed to analyze the effects of different product categories or pricing strategies on sales.

### 5. Reporting and Visualization

- **Dashboard Creation**: An interactive dashboard will be created to display sales data, forecasts, and performance analytics.
  
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive graphs using Plotly or Dash will allow users to filter and interact with data.

### 6. Web Application Development

- **Frontend Development**: The frontend will be developed using ReactJS, and the design will be enhanced with frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
  
- **Backend Development**: The backend will be developed using Flask. The backend will handle data processing, analysis, and user requests.

- **User Interaction**: Users can create accounts, log in, and access their data. Feedback forms will also be available to improve the platform.

### 7. Automation and OOP Structure

- **OOP Principles**: The codebase will be structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
  
- **Automatic Reporting**: Automation will be implemented via cron jobs or a Python bot to update data and generate reports at regular intervals.

## Features

- **Sales and Demand Forecasting**: Predict future sales using historical data, with visualization tools for performance analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard displaying real-time data and analytics.
- **User Feedback System**: Users can provide feedback on analysis results to help improve the system.
- **A/B Testing**: Test different pricing or product strategies and measure their effect on sales.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:
